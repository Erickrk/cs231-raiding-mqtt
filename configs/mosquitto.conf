# =================================================================
# General configuration
# =================================================================

# Use per listener security settings.
#
# It is recommended this option be set before any other options.
#
# If this option is set to true, then all authentication and access control
# options are controlled on a per listener basis. The following options are
# affected:
#
# acl_file
# allow_anonymous
# allow_zero_length_clientid
# auto_id_prefix
# password_file
# plugin
# plugin_opt_*
# psk_file
#
# Note that if set to true, then a durable client (i.e. with clean session set
# to false) that has disconnected will use the ACL settings defined for the
# listener that it was most recently connected to.
#
# The default behaviour is for this to be set to false, which maintains the
# setting behaviour from previous versions of mosquitto.
per_listener_settings false

# QoS 1 and 2 messages will be allowed inflight per client until this limit
# is exceeded.  Defaults to 0. (No maximum)
# See also max_inflight_messages
max_inflight_bytes 0

# The maximum number of QoS 1 and 2 messages currently inflight per
# client.
# This includes messages that are partway through handshakes and
# those that are being retried. Defaults to 20. Set to 0 for no
# maximum. Setting to 1 will guarantee in-order delivery of QoS 1
# and 2 messages.
max_inflight_messages 20

# Set the maximum QoS supported. Clients publishing at a QoS higher than
# specified here will be disconnected.
max_qos 2

# The maximum number of QoS 1 and 2 messages to hold in a queue per client
# above those that are currently in-flight.  Defaults to 1000. Set
# to 0 for no maximum (not recommended).
# See also queue_qos0_messages.
# See also max_queued_bytes.
max_queued_messages 1000

# Set to false to disable retained message support. If a client publishes a
# message with the retain bit set, it will be disconnected if this is set to
# false.
retain_available true

# =================================================================
# Listeners
# =================================================================

# Listen on a port/ip address combination. By using this variable
# multiple times, mosquitto can listen on more than one port. If
# this variable is used and neither bind_address nor port given,
# then the default listener will not be started.
# The port number to listen on must be given. Optionally, an ip
# address or host name may be supplied as a second argument. In
# this case, mosquitto will attempt to bind the listener to that
# address and so restrict access to the associated network and
# interface. By default, mosquitto will listen on all interfaces.
# Note that for a websockets listener it is not possible to bind to a host
# name.
#
# On systems that support Unix Domain Sockets, it is also possible
# to create a # Unix socket rather than opening a TCP socket. In
# this case, the port number should be set to 0 and a unix socket
# path must be provided, e.g.
# listener 0 /tmp/mosquitto.sock
#
# listener port-number [ip address/host name/unix socket path]
allow_anonymous true
listener 1883

# The maximum number of client connections to allow. This is
# a per listener setting.
# Default is -1, which means unlimited connections.
# Note that other process limits mean that unlimited connections
# are not really possible. Typically the default maximum number of
# connections possible is around 1024.
max_connections -1

# =================================================================
# Persistence
# =================================================================

# If persistence is enabled, save the in-memory database to disk
# every autosave_interval seconds. If set to 0, the persistence
# database will only be written when mosquitto exits. See also
# autosave_on_changes.
# Note that writing of the persistence database can be forced by
# sending mosquitto a SIGUSR1 signal.
autosave_interval 180

# If true, mosquitto will count the number of subscription changes, retained
# messages received and queued messages and if the total exceeds
# autosave_interval then the in-memory database will be saved to disk.
# If false, mosquitto will save the in-memory database to disk by treating
# autosave_interval as a time in seconds.
autosave_on_changes false

# Save persistent message data to disk (true/false).
# This saves information about all messages, including
# subscriptions, currently in-flight messages and retained
# messages.
# retained_persistence is a synonym for this option.
persistence true

# The filename to use for the persistent database, not including
# the path.
persistence_file mosquitto.db

# Location for persistent database.
# Default is an empty string (current directory).
# Set to e.g. /var/lib/mosquitto if running as a proper service on Linux or
# similar.
#persistence_location
